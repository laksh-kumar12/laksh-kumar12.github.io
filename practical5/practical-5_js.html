          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is
          high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
          curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
          object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS,
          JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11]
          Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12]
          often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] Most web browsers have
          a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's
          device. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports
          event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
          application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
          dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
          Object Model (DOM).
