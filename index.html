      Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user
      interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so
      that users can view and interact with that website.Hyper Text Markup
      Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website development process,
      without which a web page does not exist. Hypertext means that text has
      links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it.Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
      controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have
      its own unique look.JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming
      language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to
      transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can
      use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to
      manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input.
